# CPPalculator
Pardon the title and my lack of creativity, lol.

### Motivation
Currently, this project is purely intended for practicing Qt and C++ programming. The calculator
app is a GUI extension of a postfix calculator that I wrote for a programming fundamentals course 
project early in my major at the University of Florida.
